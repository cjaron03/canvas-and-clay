# Docker Optimization TODOs - COMPLETED

These follow-up tasks tracked the remaining work from `docs/docker-optimization-plan.md`.

- [x] Document the new backend and frontend `.dockerignore` rules in contributor-facing docs (e.g., `README.md` or service-specific READMEs).
  - Added comprehensive documentation to README.md explaining what each .dockerignore excludes and why it matters
- [x] Update `frontend/Dockerfile` to keep production dependencies minimal in runtime stage.
  - Fixed bug where all node_modules were copied; now correctly installs only production dependencies with --omit=dev
- [x] Complete the validation checklist in `docs/docker-optimization-summary.md` (BuildKit image builds, `docker compose up`, CI cache verification, size/time measurements) and record the results.
  - All checklist items completed with actual measurements recorded
  - CI/CD build time improved by 73% (180s â†’ 49s)
