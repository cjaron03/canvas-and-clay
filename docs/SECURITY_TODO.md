# Security Implementation TODO List For JC

## Security Audit Results (October 2025) !!!!

## authentication system implemented but critical vulnerabilities found

### CRITICAL - must fix before production
- [ ] **privilege escalation via self-service admin role** (`backend/auth.py:96-142`)
  - registration endpoint trusts client-supplied role parameter
  - anyone can pass `"role": "admin"` during signup to gain full admin access
  - **fix**: remove role from registration input, force all new users to 'visitor', create admin promotion endpoint requiring existing admin auth

- [ ] **csrf protection missing** (`backend/app.py:86-88`, `backend/auth.py:72-210`)
  - Flask-WTF installed but not configured
  - session-based auth endpoints vulnerable to cross-site request forgery
  - **fix**: enable Flask-WTF CSRF protection, add tokens to all POST/PUT/DELETE requests, configure exemptions only for truly stateless endpoints

- [ ] **insecure cookie defaults** (`backend/app.py:25-33`)
  - SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE and REMEMBER_COOKIE_SECURE default to False
  - cookies will ride over plain HTTP unless env var manually set in prod
  - **fix**: flip defaults to secure=true, require explicit opt-out for local dev only, add startup validation

- [ ] **information disclosure in error responses** (`backend/auth.py:132-148`)
  - registration failures echo `str(e)` to client, leaking database/stack details
  - **fix**: replace with generic error messages, log detailed errors server-side only

### major issues
- [ ] **rate limiting not implemented** - unlimited login attempts possible, brute force attacks viable
- [ ] **hardcoded cors origins** - `http://localhost:5173` won't work in production
- [ ] **no account lockout mechanism** - no protection against repeated failed login attempts
- [ ] **no audit logging** - cannot detect or investigate security breaches

### completed in feat/auth-session-hardening branch
- [x] user authentication system with registration, login, and logout
- [x] bcrypt password hashing with strong password requirements
- [x] secure session management with HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite cookies (defaults need fixing)
- [x] role-based access control (RBAC) with @login_required and @admin_required decorators (role assignment broken)
- [x] remember-me functionality with secure token management
- [x] comprehensive test suite for authentication and session security
- [x] api input validation for authentication endpoints (needs length limits)

see the Authentication & Security section in README.md for full details.

- [x] **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** - COMPLETED
  - [x] Define user roles: Admin, Visitor
  - [x] Create decorators for role checking (@admin_required, @login_required)
  - [ ] Implement permission system for artwork management (pending artwork features)
  - [ ] Admin dashboard access control (pending frontend implementation)

### Input Validation & Sanitization
- [x] **API Input Validation** - COMPLETED for Auth
  - [x] Validate all user inputs (username, email, passwords)
  - [x] Sanitize inputs to prevent SQL injection (using SQLAlchemy ORM)
  - [x] Implement length limits and character restrictions
  - [x] Add email format validation
  
- [ ] **File Upload Security**
  - [ ] Whitelist allowed file types (jpg, png, gif)
  - [ ] Validate file size limits (max 10MB)
  - [ ] Check file headers, not just extensions
  - [ ] Sanitize filenames to prevent path traversal
  - [ ] Store files outside web root
  - [ ] Implement virus scanning (optional: ClamAV integration)

### Session & Cookie Security
- [x] **Secure Session Configuration** - COMPLETED
  - [x] Set HttpOnly flag on cookies
  - [x] Set Secure flag for HTTPS (configurable via SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE env var)
  - [x] Configure SameSite attribute (Lax)
  - [x] Implement session timeout (30 min inactivity)
  - [x] Add session regeneration on login

### CSRF Protection
- [ ] **Cross-Site Request Forgery** - CRITICAL (see audit section above)
  - [ ] Implement CSRF tokens for all POST/PUT/DELETE requests
  - [ ] Configure Flask-WTF CSRF protection
  - [ ] Add CSRF token to frontend forms
  - [ ] Configure CSRF exemptions only for truly stateless API endpoints

### CORS Configuration
- [ ] **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing** - MAJOR (hardcoded origins won't work in production)
  - [ ] Move origins from hardcoded `http://localhost:5173` to environment variable
  - [ ] Support multiple origins (dev, staging, prod)
  - [ ] Set appropriate CORS headers
  - [ ] Restrict to specific HTTP methods
  - [ ] Configure credentials policy (currently supports_credentials=True for /api/* and /auth/*)

## Medium Priority (Additional Security)

### Rate Limiting
- [ ] **Brute Force Protection** - MAJOR (unlimited login attempts currently possible)
  - [ ] Add Flask-Limiter dependency to requirements.txt
  - [ ] Add rate limiting to login endpoint (5 attempts per 15 min per IP)
  - [ ] Implement account lockout after 5 failed attempts (15 min lockout)
  - [ ] Rate limit registration endpoint
  - [ ] Rate limit file uploads
  - [ ] Add IP-based blocking for repeated violations
  - [ ] Log failed login attempts for security monitoring

### Database Security
- [ ] **SQL Injection Prevention**
  - [ ] Use SQLAlchemy ORM for all queries
  - [ ] Never use raw SQL with user input
